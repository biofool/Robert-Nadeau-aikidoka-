'''Robert Nadeau ''' (born March 10, 1937) is an American [[aikido]] teacher holding the rank of 8th [[dan rank|dan]] and [[shihan|master teacher]](''Shihan'') in the [[Aikikai]].
Nadeau began training in [[martial arts]] at the age of 16 and began studying Aikido with American instructor Robert Tan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Tan|url=https://aikidojournal.com/2002/11/28/interview-with-robert-nadeau/}}</ref>

After Training in [[Japan]] with the founder of Aikido, [[Morihei Ueshiba]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Study with Founder|url=https://aikidojournal.com/2002/11/28/interview-with-robert-nadeau/}}</ref> {{Nihongo|[[sensei|''Ōsensei'']]|大先生/翁先生}}, "Great Teacher" from 1962-1964 Nadeau returned to [[Northern California]] and opened a series of martial art schools sharing space with first [[Professor Sig Kuferath]] and then [[Richard Bunch]] through whom he has had on-going contact with several notable Ju-Jitsu schools<ref>{{cite book|title=1965 Black Belt Magazine|date = March 1965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNcDAAAAMBAJ&q=Nadeau&pg=PA14}}</ref> and which eventually led to the formation of the California Aikido Association.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Aikido Association|url=http://ai-ki-do.org//}}</ref> He is one of three division heads of the California Aikido Association and is also the founder and head instructor of City Aikido of [[San Francisco]], Aikido of San Jose, and Aikido of [[Mountain View, CA]].

Nadeau is well known as a pioneer in the energy and awareness aspects of aikido,<ref>[[George Leonard]], ''The Ultimate Athlete. Revising Sports, Physical Education and the Body'', The Viking Press 1975.</ref><ref>[[Richard Strozzi Heckler]], ''The Anatomy of Change. East/West Approaches to Body/Mind Therapy'', [[Shambhala Publications]] 1985.</ref><ref>''Aikido in America'' pg 57</ref><ref group="">{{cite book|last=Stone|first=John|title=Aikido In America|year=1995|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=1883319277|pages=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNqZ19LPte8C}}</ref> having dedicated his lifes work to understanding and translating these principles handed down by Ueshiba into fields beyond aikido, including [[psychotherapy]], [[personal development]].

==Relationship with Morihei Ueshiba==
[[File:Nadeau_teaching_certificate.jpg|thumb|Rare teaching certification|alt=teaching certification]] At the end of his study in Japan Nadeau was issued a rare certificate of recognition as an authorized Aikido teacher signed by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] and [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]].
In addition to his enrollment as an Aikido student at Hombu Dojo from 1962-1964 and maintaining a full training and meditation practice during his time in Japan, Nadeau had a close and substantial off-the-mat relationship with [[Morihei Ueshiba]], which included regular extended trips to the [[Iwama, Ibaraki|Japanese countryside]].  Nadeau also assumed the position of publisher of an English-language newsletter about aikido while studying in Japan.  By asking questions during small and sometimes private meetings, Nadeau learned first-hand some of the ideas and philosophies that Ueshiba wished to pass on to interested students.  Fundamental among these teachings was the concept of "two forces" that combine to produce a new identity and "levels" which progress from limited to enhanced capabilities and awareness.  Nadeau refers to the process of moving from one level to the next as an [[Alchemical]] transformation. According to Nadeau, this progression occurs in the "functioning realm", i.e. in a manner that improves functioning in everyday life.

== What O'Sensei said to him ==
If he managed to understand the secret of Aikido, he could accomplish all the very same incredible techniques that O Sensei performed himself in just three months. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-04-13 |title=Aikido: Expression of Yin and Yang in Motion |url=https://guillaumeerard.com/aikido/articles-aikido/aikido-expression-of-yin-and-yang-in-motion/ |access-date=2022-06-01 |website=GuillaumeErard.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Teaching Lineage==
[[File:Ueshiba scroll at City Aikido.png|thumb|Scroll presented to Robert Nadeau by Morihei Ueshiba which translates as "Do the aikido that cannot be seen with the human eye"]]
Morihei Ueshiba spoke of [[Izanagi]] (male) and [[Izanami]] (female), the two great forces that, in [[Shinto]] mythology, created the islands of Japan.  Or again, he spoke of Fire - Water - Steam as another example of two forces combining to yield a third transformed entity.  These [[alchemical]] concepts have infused Nadeau's teaching since his return from his studies with Ueshiba in Japan in 1964.  As a reminder of these direct transmissions, Ueshiba presented Nadeau with several scrolls amongst which are one was translated as "Do the aikido that cannot be seen with the human eye".
